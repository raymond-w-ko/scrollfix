This plugin, scrollfix, maintains cursor at fixed visual line of window
(except near beginning of file and near end of file. The
latter is configurable. You can choose whether to fix cursor
near end of file or not, see g:fixeof below). This is enhancement
to the 'set scrolloff=999', but scrollfix allows any visual line of
window to keep cursor at, not only middle line of window.

MAIN CONTROL VARIABLE, THE g:scrollfix:

You choose the visual line of screen in percentages from top of screen:
    let g:scrollfix=100 " means lock cursor at bottom of window
    let g:scrollfix=0   " means keep cursor at top line of window
    let g:scrollfix=50  " means middle line of screen
    let g:scrollfix=66  " means two-third from top of screen
As shipped, cursor is at 60% (let g:scrollfix=60)

CONTROL VARIABLES:
To change plugin settings, assign to following variables in your .vimrc.
g:scrollfix - percentage from top of screen where to lock cursor
              -1 - disables. Default: 60
g:fixeof    - 1=>fix cursor also near end-of-file; 0=>no. Default:0
g:scrollinfo - 1=>inform when scrollfix is turned on, 0=>no. Default: 1
:FIX NNN         comand :FIX is alternate way to change g:scrollfix variable

NB:
- You need vim version at least 7.0.91 or later (vim6 won't work).
  If you have vim7 before 7.0.91, you can use script#1473 to build
  & install the latest vim7 executable.
- this is beta version of the scrollfix plugin.
