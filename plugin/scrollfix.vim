" This plugin, scrollfix, maintains the cursor at a fixed visual line of the
" window (except when near the beginning of file and near end of file). The
" latter is configurable. You can choose whether to fix the cursor near the
" end of file or not, see g:scrollfix_fixeof below). This is an enhancement to
" the 'set scrolloff=999' setting that allows the visual line of window to be
" anywhere, not just the middle line of window.
"
" You choose the visual line of the screen in percentages from top of screen.
" For example, setting 100 means lock cursor to the bottom line of the screen,
" setting 0 means keeping the cursor at top line of screen, setting 50 means
" middle line of screen, setting 60 (default) is about two-thirds from the top
" of the screen. As shipped, cursor is at 60% (let g:scrollfix=60). You control
" percentage of scrollfix in following ways:
" - :set g:scrollfix=NNN   " in vimrc. -1 disables plugin
" - edit file ~/.vim/plugin/scrollfix.vim, change number in line
"         :let g:scrollfix=NNN
" - command :FIX NNN
"
" CONTROL VARIABLES:
" g:scrollfix - percentage from top of screen where to lock cursor
"               -1 - disables. Default: 60
" g:scrollfix_fixeof    - 1=>fix cursor also near end-of-file; 0=>no. Default:0
" g:scrollinfo - 1=>inform when scrollfix is turned on, 0=>no. Default: 1
"
" NB:
" - You need vim version at least 7.0.91 or later (vim6 won't work).
"   If you have vim7 before 7.0.91, you can use script#1473 to build
"   & install the latest vim7 executable.
" - this is beta version of the scrollfix plugin.
"   Your feedback is welcome. Please send your feedback to iler at gmail dot com.
